## API Aggregation Service Documentation

This document describes the API Aggregation Service, a central point for retrieving aggregated data from multiple sources. It fetches data from various APIs, processes it if necessary, and provides a unified interface for consuming applications.

### Endpoint

The API Aggregation Service exposes a single endpoint:

* **GET /v1/GetAggregatedData/{city}** (Retrieves aggregated weather and news data for a city)

### Input/Output Formats

**Request:**

* The request is made using the HTTP GET method.
* The city name is provided as a path parameter in the URL.

**Response:**

* The response format is JSON.
* The response object contains weather and news data for the specified city:
    * **weather** (object): Weather information
    * **news** (array of objects): News articles related to the city
    * **ipGeolocation** (object): IP geolocation information 
* In case of success, the response will typically include a status code indicating success (e.g., 200 OK).
* In case of failure, an error message describing the issue will be included in the response with an appropriate error code (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error).

### Setup and Configuration

The API Aggregation Service requires the following configuration:

* **API Keys:** You need to provide API keys for each external API you want to aggregate data from (e.g., OpenWeatherMap for weather data, News API for news articles). These keys are typically used for authentication and authorization purposes when calling the external APIs.

### Additional Notes

* Consider implementing caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data to improve performance and reduce load on the external APIs.
* Implement proper error handling and retry logic for external API calls to ensure service robustness.
* Secure your API endpoint using appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.

**User Interface (UI)**

In addition to the API endpoints, the service also provides a basic user interface (UI) for visualizing the aggregated data. You can access the UI at the following URL: https://localhost:7117/index.html
